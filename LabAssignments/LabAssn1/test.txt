Me. Can you focus on me1 
Baby, can you focus on me1
Babe
Hands in the soap
Have the faucet's running
And I keep looking at you
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clueJun2
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on
Me
Can you focus on me1
Baby, can you focus on me1
Me
Me
Can you focus on me1
Baby, can you focus on me1
Lazy and broke1
No, he get this money
So I guess I can't complain
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on
Me
Can you focus on me1
Baby, can you focus on me1
Baby
Me
Can you focus on me1
Baby, can you focus on me1
Me
Baby, focus
Can't you see1
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes
